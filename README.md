## Setting up your dev environment

Supports Python 3.6+ and has been tested so far to run on Windows systems.

1. Make sure that the version of python you see when you rn `python --version` is 3.6 or higher.
2. Run `virtualenv ENVNAME` to create a new virtual environment named ENVNAME (choose whatever you like, typical is venv).
3. Run `.\venv\Scripts\activate` to activate the virtual environemtn after its created.
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the required dependencies for this project.

Simple as pie. Once these steps are done, you should be good to go.
